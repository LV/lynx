# Draft
- The following document collects a draft of a process for capturing information
    - Hopefully, will be the basis from which this software will be constructed
- Ironically, this does not yet follow the sort of organizational structure for capturing information as I'd like
    - This is because I do not know yet of a good structure to do so
- These 'ideas' come primarily from SÃ¶nke Ahrens's book _How to Take Smart Notes_
    - As of starting this document, I only just completed chapter 1

## Key Points and Ideas from Book
### 0: Introduction
- "Every intellectual endeavor starts with a note"
- "Improving the organization of all writing makes a difference"
- "Good productive writing is based on good note-taking"
- **"The quality of a paper and the ease to which it is written depends more than anything on _what you have done in writing before you even make a decision on the topic_"**
- "Self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our _environment_ than with ourselves"
- "Not _having_ willpower, but _not_ having to _use_ willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success"

### 1: Everything You Need to Know
- "A good structure is something you can trust"
- "A good structure enables _flow_"
- A clear structure is not the same as the word _planning_
    - Clear structure allows for being dynamic
    - Planning is more rigid and fixed


## Types of Notes
### Fleeting Notes
- "Throwaway" notes
- The collection of fleeting notes can be thought of as an 'inbox'
    - Meaning, to be processed later
- If thoughts are already sorted and have the time, this step can be skipped

### Literature Notes
- Notes on the content you are currently consuming
- 

## Things I would like
- It is dumb to create a whole new editor
    - This solution should simply be the organizational component of notes
    - Should be complimentary to a user's workflow
    - Therefore, should invoke the editor the user wants to use (i.e. `$EDITOR`)
        - e.g. I want to write my notes with Vim keybindings
